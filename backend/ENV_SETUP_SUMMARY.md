# Environment Variables Setup Summary

We've implemented a robust system for managing environment variables in the EventWish AdMob backend. This summary outlines the changes made and how to use them.

## New Files Created

1. **`scripts/generate-secrets.js`**
   - Generates secure random values for JWT_SECRET, API_KEY, and INTERNAL_API_KEY
   - Provides formatted output for both local development and Render.com

2. **`config/env-loader.js`**
   - Loads environment variables from .env file
   - Provides fallbacks for development environments
   - Ensures critical environment variables are set

3. **`scripts/check-env.js`**
   - Checks if required environment variables are set
   - Provides a summary of environment variable status

4. **`scripts/env-debug.js`**
   - Directly logs environment variables for debugging
   - Masks sensitive values for security

5. **`scripts/test-auth.js`**
   - Tests authentication middleware with the API key
   - Verifies protected endpoints require authentication

6. **`ENV_SETUP.md`**
   - Provides instructions for setting up environment variables locally

7. **`RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md`**
   - Provides specific instructions for setting up environment variables on Render.com

## Changes to Existing Files

1. **`server.js`**
   - Updated to use the environment loader
   - Ensures environment variables are loaded before the application starts

2. **`package.json`**
   - Added new scripts for managing environment variables:
     - `generate-secrets`: Generates secure random values
     - `check-env`: Checks if required environment variables are set
     - `test:auth`: Tests authentication middleware
   - Added pre-start hooks to check environment variables before starting the application

## How to Use

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. Generate secure keys:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-secrets
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the generated values (or update existing one)

3. Check if environment variables are set:
   ```bash
   npm run check-env
   ```

### Testing Authentication

Test if authentication middleware is working correctly:
```bash
npm run test:auth
```

### Deploying to Render.com

Follow the instructions in `RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md` to set up environment variables on Render.com.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly rotate secrets, especially in production
- Use different secrets for development and production
- Monitor for unauthorized access to API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with environment variables:

1. Run `npm run check-env` to verify environment variables are set
2. Run `node scripts/env-debug.js` to see the actual values
3. Check the application logs for any errors related to environment variables
4. Verify that the `.env` file is in the correct location and has the correct format

## Next Steps

- Implement a secret rotation schedule
- Add monitoring for authentication failures
- Consider using a secrets management service for production
