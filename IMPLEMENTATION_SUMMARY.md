# Implementation Summary: Local API Testing with Build Variants

## Changes Made

1. **Added Build Variants in `app/build.gradle`**
   - Added `local` build variant specifically for local development
   - Configured different `BASE_URL` values for each build variant:
     - `debug`: Uses production API
     - `local`: Uses local development server (http://192.168.1.100:5000/api/)
     - `release`: Uses production API

2. **Updated `ApiClient.java` to use BuildConfig**
   - Replaced hardcoded BASE_URL with BuildConfig.BASE_URL
   - This allows switching between environments without code changes

3. **Added Network Security Configuration**
   - Created `app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
   - Added configuration to allow cleartext traffic for local development
   - Updated AndroidManifest.xml to reference the network security config

4. **Added Helper Scripts**
   - Created `tools/find_local_ip.sh` for Linux/Mac users
   - Created `tools/find_local_ip.ps1` for Windows users
   - These scripts help developers find their local IP address

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added instructions in README.md for using local development setup
   - Included steps for configuring and using build variants

## How to Use

1. Find your local IP address using the provided scripts:
   - Windows: `.\tools\find_local_ip.ps1`
   - Linux/Mac: `./tools/find_local_ip.sh`

2. Update the `local` build variant in `app/build.gradle` with your IP address:
   ```groovy
   buildConfigField "String", "BASE_URL", "\"http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000/api/\""
   ```

3. Update the network security config in `app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:
   ```xml
   <domain includeSubdomains="true">YOUR_IP_ADDRESS</domain>
   ```

4. Select the "local" build variant in Android Studio and run the app.

5. Your app will now connect to your local API server for testing.

## Benefits

- Rapid development and testing with real devices
- No need to redeploy API for testing changes
- Easy switching between local and production environments
- Proper security configuration for development and production
