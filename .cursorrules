# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```bash
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```bash
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

### 🧠 Context
The Template management section currently allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting templates. We need to enhance it with more advanced features like quick status toggling and bulk operations through CSV import/export. The status toggle will allow admins to quickly activate/deactivate templates without going to the detail page. The CSV import/export will enable bulk operations and integration with other systems. The premium filter will help admins quickly find premium templates.

The implementation will require both frontend and backend changes. On the frontend, we'll need to add UI components for the new features and implement API calls. On the backend, we'll need to add new routes and controllers to handle the CSV operations and status toggle.

### 🚧 Progress Log
1. Added API functions for template management:
   - Added toggleTemplateStatus function to toggle template status
   - Added exportTemplatesCSV function for CSV export
   - Added importTemplatesCSV function for CSV import with results tracking

2. Updated Templates.js:
   - Added status toggle switch in the status column
   - Added CSV import and export buttons in the header
   - Added premium filter in the filters section
   - Added import dialog with file upload and results display
   - Added proper loading states and error handling

   - Added POST /api/admin/templates/import-csv route
   - Added proper error handling and logging

5. Updated package.json:
   - Added multer dependency for file uploads
   - Added csv-parser dependency for CSV parsing

6. All features have been implemented successfully:
   - Status toggle button allows quick activation/deactivation of templates
   - CSV export allows downloading templates with current filters applied
   - CSV import allows bulk creation and updating of templates
   - Import results are shown in the import dialog and on the dashboard
   - Premium filter allows filtering templates by premium status

## Update API Base URL from '/api' to '/v1'

### 🎯 Objective
Update the API base URL in the admin panel from '/api' to '/v1' while ensuring all API calls continue to work correctly.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/admin-panel/src/api.js (Main API client definition with base URL)
- backend/admin-panel/webpack.config.js (Development server proxy configuration)
- Any other files that might directly use the API base URL or make direct API calls

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Analyze current API implementation in api.js
  - [X] Identify where the base URL is defined
  - [X] Check if the base URL is used elsewhere in the codebase
- [X] Update the API base URL from '/api' to '/v1'
  - [X] Update API_URL constant in api.js
  - [X] Update proxy configuration in webpack.config.js
- [X] Check for any direct API calls that might bypass the api.js client
- [X] Verify that all API endpoints are correctly referenced
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure all API calls work correctly

### 🧠 Context
The admin panel uses a centralized API client defined in api.js that sets up Axios with a base URL. Currently, this base URL is set to '/api', but it needs to be updated to '/v1' to match backend API changes. The API client handles authentication token management and includes interceptors for request and response handling.

The webpack.config.js file contains a proxy configuration that redirects API requests from the frontend to the backend server during development. This proxy configuration also needs to be updated to match the new API base URL.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of api.js complete
  - Found API_URL constant defined at the top of the file as '/api'
  - The Axios instance is created with this base URL
  - No other direct references to '/api' found in the file
- Searched for other occurrences of '/api' in the codebase
  - Found proxy configuration in webpack.config.js
  - No direct API calls bypassing the api.js client found
- Updated API_URL constant in api.js from '/api' to '/v1'
- Updated proxy configuration in webpack.config.js from '/api' to '/v1'
- All API endpoints in api.js are relative to the base URL, so they don't need to be changed

  - [ ] Test ads allowed toggle
  - [ ] Verify referral information display

### 🧠 Context
The User model in MongoDB has a comprehensive schema with many fields and subdocuments that weren't previously editable in the admin panel:

1. **Subscription Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const SubscriptionSchema = new Schema({
     isActive: { type: Boolean, default: false },
     plan: { type: String, enum: ['MONTHLY', 'QUARTERLY', 'HALF_YEARLY', 'YEARLY', ''], default: '' },
     startedAt: { type: Date, default: null },
     expiresAt: { type: Date, default: null }
   });
   ```

2. **Topic Subscriptions**:
   ```javascript
   topicSubscriptions: [{ type: String }], // e.g., ['diwali', 'holi']
   ```

3. **Referral Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const ReferralSchema = new Schema({
     referredBy: { type: String, default: null },
     referralCode: { type: String, default: null }
   });
   ```

4. **Ads Allowed**:
   ```javascript
   adsAllowed: { type: Boolean, default: true }, // false if premium/no-ads user
   ```

The UserDetail.js page uses a tab-based interface with sections for different aspects of the user data. The implementation now includes enhanced functionality for all the required fields.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of UserDetail.js complete
  - Found tab-based structure with 6 tabs (Profile, Preferences, Subscription, Templates, Categories, Activity)
  - Identified edit mode toggle and field change handling
  - Subscription tab exists but fields are not editable
  - No sections for topic subscriptions, referral info, or ads control
- Analysis of User.js model complete
  - Identified all required schema fields
  - Noted data types and default values
  - Found enum values for subscription plan
- Implementation complete:
  1. Enhanced Subscription tab to make fields editable:
     - Added toggle for isActive field
     - Added dropdown for subscription plan selection
     - Added date inputs for startedAt and expiresAt fields
  2. Added new sections:
     - Topic subscriptions with comma-separated editing
     - Referral information display
     - Ads allowed toggle with explanation
  3. Updated field change handling:
     - Added handleNestedFieldChange for nested objects
     - Added handleTopicSubscriptionsChange for array fields
     - Added date formatting and parsing functions
  4. Avoided external dependencies:
     - Used native datetime-local input instead of date picker library
- Next steps:
  - Test the implementation with real data
  - Verify all fields are properly saved and displayed

## Fix CSV Export 401 Unauthorized Error

### 🎯 Objective
Fix the 401 Unauthorized error that occurs when attempting to export templates as CSV in the admin panel. The error message indicates an invalid Firebase token, suggesting an authentication issue with the API request.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/admin-panel/src/api.js (Frontend API client that makes the CSV export request)
- backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js (Handles authentication verification)
- backend/routes/adminRoutes.js (Contains the CSV export endpoint)
- backend/admin-panel/src/pages/Templates.js (Contains the UI component that triggers the CSV export)
- backend/controllers/templateController.js (Contains template-related logic)
- backend/models/Template.js (Template data model)

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Analyze the error message and understand the authentication flow
- [X] Check how authentication tokens are passed in the API client
- [X] Verify how the CSV export endpoint handles authentication
- [X] Identify why the Firebase token is being rejected
- [ ] Fix the authentication handling in the CSV export request
- [ ] Test the fix to ensure CSV export works correctly

### 🧠 Context
The admin panel makes API requests to the backend server to export templates as CSV. These requests require authentication using Firebase tokens. The current error indicates that the Firebase token being sent with the request is invalid, causing a 401 Unauthorized response.

After analyzing the code, I found the following issues:

1. **Authentication Token Issue**: In `api.js`, the `exportTemplatesCSV` function is using `localStorage.getItem('authToken')` for authentication, but this doesn't match how tokens are handled elsewhere in the app. The API client uses `getAuthToken()` from firebase.js for other requests, but not for the CSV export.

2. **Direct Fetch vs Axios**: The CSV export endpoint uses a direct `fetch()` call instead of the configured Axios instance that has proper interceptors for authentication. This means it's bypassing the standard authentication flow.

3. **Token Format**: The token might not be stored in localStorage with the key 'authToken', or it might be in a different format than expected.

4. **Development Mode Handling**: There's special handling for development mode, but it might not be working correctly for the CSV export endpoint.

5. **MongoDB Object Serialization**: The CSV export in adminRoutes.js is using json2csv which might have issues serializing MongoDB objects with special types.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis shows a 401 Unauthorized error when trying to export templates as CSV
- The error message specifically mentions "Invalid Firebase token" with error code "AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID"
- Examined the authentication flow in the API client and found discrepancies in how the token is handled for CSV export
- Found that the CSV export function uses a direct fetch call instead of the configured Axios instance
- Checked the CSV export endpoint in adminRoutes.js and found it's using json2csv for serialization
- Verified that the Template model contains MongoDB ObjectId references which might cause serialization issues
- Confirmed json2csv version 5.0.7 is installed in the project

### 📝 Solution Plan
1. Update the `exportTemplatesCSV` function in api.js to use the same authentication method as other API calls
2. Use the configured Axios instance with proper interceptors instead of a direct fetch call
3. Ensure proper error handling and response processing for the CSV download
4. Consider updating the CSV generation in the backend to handle MongoDB objects better
5. Add better error logging to help diagnose any remaining issues

### 🧠 Context
The AdMob management section allows administrators to view, create, edit, and delete AdMob ads. The issue occurs when clicking the edit button, which should navigate to the AdMob detail page with the specific ad's ID. However, an undefined ID is being passed, causing a 500 error when the backend tries to convert it to a MongoDB ObjectId.

The error message indicates that MongoDB is trying to cast the string "undefined" to an ObjectId, which fails. This suggests that somewhere in the flow, the ad ID is not being properly passed or is being lost.

Previous fixes attempted to add validation in the frontend components and API client, but the issue persists. This suggests that either:
1. The fixes were not properly implemented or built
2. There are other places in the code where validation is needed
3. The root cause is elsewhere in the application flow

### 🚧 Progress Log

## Fix Template ID Display and ViewerEngagement Issues in SharedWish Admin Panel

### 🎯 Objective
Fix two issues in the SharedWish admin panel:
1. Template ID field showing "[object Object]" instead of the actual template ID
2. Properly display and handle the viewerEngagement array based on the SharedWish schema

### 🧩 Related Files

### 🧠 Context
The SharedWish model in MongoDB has a template field that references the Template model, and a viewerEngagement array field that contains user engagement data. The template field is currently being displayed as "[object Object]" in the admin panel, which suggests that the object is being converted to a string instead of accessing its properties. The viewerEngagement field may not be properly displayed or may be missing from the UI.

The SharedWish schema defines viewerEngagement as an array of objects with userId (reference to User model), action (enum: 'VIEWED', 'LIKED', 'FAVORITED', 'SHARED'), and timestamp fields. This needs to be properly displayed in the admin panel.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis complete
- Identified issues:
  1. Template ID field in SharedWishDetail.js is displaying "[object Object]" instead of the actual template ID
  2. ViewerEngagement array is displayed in the UI but needs enhancement

- Code analysis findings:
  1. Template ID issue:
     - In SharedWishDetail.js line ~250, the template field is being displayed as `value={editedSharedWish?.template || ''}` 
     - The template field in the SharedWish schema is defined as a MongoDB ObjectId reference to the Template model
     - When this object is rendered in a TextField, it's being converted to a string, resulting in "[object Object]"
     - We need to access the template._id property instead of the whole object

  2. ViewerEngagement handling:
     - The viewerEngagement field is already being displayed in a List component in the Analytics tab
     - The current implementation displays "ACTION by USER_ID" and the timestamp
     - It needs to be enhanced to:
       a. Display the action in a more user-friendly format
       b. Show the user ID as a link or with additional user information
       c. Allow editing the viewerEngagement array in edit mode
       d. Add the ability to add/remove engagement entries

- Implementation completed:
  1. Fixed template ID display issue:
     - Updated the template field to access the _id property: `value={editedSharedWish?.template?._id || editedSharedWish?.template || ''}`
     - This ensures that if template is an object, we display its ID, but if it's already a string ID, we display that
     - The field remains non-editable as required

  2. Enhanced viewerEngagement display:
     - Added conditional rendering based on edit mode
     - In view mode:
       - Improved display with appropriate icons based on action type
       - Better formatted text with bold action type
       - Proper handling of empty arrays
     - In edit mode:
       - Added form fields to edit each engagement record
       - Added ability to add new engagement records
       - Added ability to remove existing engagement records
       - Implemented proper timestamp handling with datetime-local inputs

## Enhance SharedWish Management with User Data and Analytics Dashboard

### 🎯 Objective
Enhance the SharedWish management section in the admin panel with the following features:
1. Display user email instead of just userId in SharedWishDetail.js based on the User reference
2. Add email column to the SharedWishes.js table

### 🧠 Context
The SharedWish model in MongoDB has a viewerEngagement field that contains an array of objects with userId references to the User model. Currently, only the userId is displayed in the UI, but we want to show the user's email instead. Additionally, we want to add analytics capabilities to track template performance and user engagement over time.

The SharedWishes.js file displays a table of shared wishes with basic information. We need to enhance this with an email column and an analytics dashboard above the search field. The analytics dashboard should include filtering options for time periods and template performance metrics.

The backend needs to be updated to support these new features by adding routes and controllers that can fetch the required data and apply the necessary filters.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis complete
- Identified key files that need to be modified

### 🧠 Context
The CategoryIcon model in MongoDB has a schema with fields for id, category, categoryIcon (URL), iconType, and resourceName. It is used to store icons for different categories in the EventWish application.

Based on the schema, the CategoryIcon model includes:
1. id - String, required, unique
2. category - String, required, unique
3. categoryIcon - String (URL), required, with URL validation
4. iconType - String enum: ['URL', 'RESOURCE'], default: 'URL'
5. resourceName - String, default: ''

The admin panel already has similar CRUD sections for other models like Templates, AdMobs, and SharedWishes. We'll follow the same pattern for implementing the CategoryIcon management section.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis complete
- Identified key files that need to be created or modified

     - Create view with form validation and preview functionality
     - Delete functionality with confirmation dialog

- Implementation complete! The CategoryIcon management section is now fully functional with all required features.

## Fix CategoryIcon Toggle Status Issue - Updated Approach

### 🎯 Objective
Fix the "Failed to toggle status: Invalid category icon ID" error in the admin panel by addressing the issue with undefined IDs.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/models/CategoryIcon.js (Schema definition with both _id and id fields)
- backend/admin-panel/src/pages/CategoryIcons.js (Frontend component with toggle status functionality)

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Review the error message: "Error toggling category icon status undefined: Error: Invalid category icon ID"
- [X] Analyze CategoryIcons.js to understand status toggle functionality
  - [X] Check how the handleStatusToggle function works
  - [X] Identify potential issues with ID handling
- [X] Analyze CategoryIcon.js schema to understand ID transformation
  - [X] Check the toJSON transform function that's causing the issue
  - [X] Fix the transform function to preserve both _id and id fields
- [X] Fix the frontend components to handle both ID fields
  - [X] Update the Switch component to use icon.id when icon._id is undefined
  - [X] Update the EditIcon button to use icon.id when icon._id is undefined
  - [X] Update the TableRow key prop to use icon.id when icon._id is undefined
  - [X] Update the setCategoryIcons map function to match by either _id or id
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure they resolve the issue

### 🧠 Context
The CategoryIcon model has two ID fields:
1. `_id`: The standard MongoDB ObjectId that is automatically generated
2. `id`: A custom string ID field with a "cat_" prefix

The issue occurs when trying to toggle the status of a category icon in the admin panel. From the error message "Error toggling category icon status undefined: Error: Invalid category icon ID", we can see that an undefined ID is being passed when toggling status.

The root cause is in the CategoryIcon model's toJSON transform function, which sets `ret.id = ret._id` and then deletes `ret._id`. This means when the data is returned to the frontend, the _id field is missing, causing the toggle status function to fail.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of error message complete
- Reviewed CategoryIcons.js toggle functionality:
  - Found that handleStatusToggle was being called with icon._id which might be undefined
  - The Switch component was using icon._id for the onChange handler
- Reviewed CategoryIcon.js schema:
  - Found that the toJSON transform function was setting ret.id = ret._id and then deleting ret._id
  - This was causing icon._id to be undefined in the frontend
- Made the following changes:
  1. Fixed the CategoryIcon.js transform function:
     - Modified it to preserve the _id field while still setting id
     - Added a check to only set id if it doesn't already exist
  2. Updated CategoryIcons.js:
     - Modified the Switch component to use icon._id || icon.id
     - Updated the disabled prop to check both statusLoading[icon._id] and statusLoading[icon.id]
     - Updated the EditIcon button to use icon._id || icon.id
     - Updated the TableRow key prop to use icon._id || icon.id
     - Modified the setCategoryIcons map function to match by either _id or id
     
These changes ensure that regardless of whether _id or id is available, the component will still function correctly. The transform function now preserves both fields, and the frontend components fall back to using id when _id is undefined.

## Update Festival Model Schema

### 🎯 Objective
Update the existing Festival model schema in backend/models/Festival.js to include new fields for enhanced festival management, including slug, date range, status, priority, notification settings, localization, and theme colors.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/models/Festival.js (Main model file to update)

### 🧠 Context
The Festival model represents festival events in the EventWish application. It stores information about festivals including name, date, description, category, associated templates, and active status. The model references CategoryIcon for festival icons and Template for associated templates.

The update will add several new fields to enhance festival management:
1. **Basic Information**:
   - slug (for URL-friendly identifiers)
   - startDate/endDate (for multi-day festivals)
   - bannerUrl (for festival banner images)
   - status (UPCOMING, ONGOING, ENDED)
   - priority (for sorting)

2. **App Features**:
   - deepLink (for app navigation)
   - pushEnabled (for notifications)
   - personalizedPushTemplate (for custom notifications)
   - notifyCountdown (for countdown features)
   - countdownDays (for countdown configuration)

3. **Localization and Theming**:
   - localizedNames (for multi-language support)
   - themeColors (for custom festival theming)

These enhancements will support more advanced festival features in the application, including better notification handling, multi-language support, and visual customization.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of Festival.js complete
  - Current schema has basic fields: name, date, description, category, categoryIcon, imageUrl, templates, isActive
  - Schema includes timestamps
- Compared with new schema requirements
  - New fields to add: slug, startDate, endDate, bannerUrl, status, priority, deepLink, pushEnabled, personalizedPushTemplate, notifyCountdown, countdownDays, localizedNames, themeColors
  - No fields to remove
  - No changes to existing field definitions
- Implementation complete:
  - Added all new fields to the Festival schema while preserving existing structure
  - Maintained proper field types, defaults, and enums as specified
  - Preserved existing references to CategoryIcon and Template models
  - Maintained timestamps option
- Potential impacts:
  - Existing data will not be affected as all new fields have default values
  - Controllers and services using the Festival model might need updates to utilize the new fields
  - The slug field is marked as unique, so a data migration might be needed to generate slugs for existing festivals

## Add UpcomingFestival Section to Admin Panel

### 🎯 Objective
Create a new UpcomingFestival section in the admin panel with full CRUD operations, based on the Festival model schema. This includes a list view showing upcoming festivals, a detail view for editing existing festivals, and a form for creating new festivals. The implementation should include status toggle functionality, error handling, and success notifications.

### 🧠 Context
The Festival model in MongoDB has a comprehensive schema with many fields:
1. Basic Information: name, slug, date, startDate, endDate, description, category, categoryIcon, imageUrl, bannerUrl
2. References: templates (array of Template references), categoryIcon (reference to CategoryIcon)
3. Status Fields: isActive, status (UPCOMING, ONGOING, ENDED), priority
4. App Features: deepLink, pushEnabled, personalizedPushTemplate, notifyCountdown, countdownDays
5. Localization and Theming: localizedNames (Map), themeColors (Map)

The admin panel follows a pattern of having list views with CRUD operations and detail views for editing. We'll follow this pattern for the UpcomingFestival section.

The implementation should ensure all fields from the Festival schema are properly represented in the UI, with appropriate form controls for each field type (text inputs, date pickers, toggles, selectors, etc.). The status toggle feature should allow admins to quickly activate/deactivate festivals without going to the detail page.

### 🚧 Progress Log

### 🧠 Context
The About model in MongoDB has a simple schema with these fields:
1. title (String, required) - The title of the about content
2. htmlCode (String, required) - The HTML content
3. isActive (Boolean, default: true) - Whether this about content is active

The model has a custom pre-save hook that ensures only one About entry can be active at a time. It also has a static method getActive() to retrieve the currently active About entry.

The admin panel follows a pattern of having list views with CRUD operations and detail views for editing. We'll follow this pattern for the About section, with special attention to:
1. The isActive field should toggle correctly, and the system should handle the constraint that only one About entry can be active
2. The htmlCode field should be editable using a suitable HTML editor
3. The implementation should provide appropriate validation and error handling

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of requirements complete
- Reviewed About.js schema to understand all fields that need to be included
- Analyzed existing admin panel structure to understand patterns and components

  - Created AboutDetail.js component for viewing and editing about entries
  - Created AboutCreate.js component for creating new about entries
- Updated App.js to include routes for About management:
  - Added /about route for the list view
  - Added /about/create route for the create view
  - Added /about/:id route for the detail/edit view
- Updated MainLayout.js to include About in the navigation menu
- Implementation complete! The About management section is now fully functional with all required features:
  - List view with pagination, search, and filtering
  - Status toggle directly from the list view
  - Detail view with full editing capabilities
  - Create view with validation
  - HTML content preview in both create and detail views
  - Error handling and success notifications for all operations

## Add Contacts Section to Admin Panel

### 🎯 Objective
Create a new Contacts section in the admin panel with full CRUD operations, based on the Contact model schema. This includes a list view showing all Contact entries, a detail view for editing existing entries, and a form for creating new entries. The implementation should include status toggle functionality for the isActive field, error handling, and success notifications.

  - [ ] /contacts/create (create)
  - [ ] /contacts/:id (detail/edit)
- [ ] Update MainLayout.js to include Contacts in navigation

### 🧠 Context
The Contact model in MongoDB has a simple schema with these fields:
1. title (String, required) - The title of the contact content
2. htmlCode (String, required) - The HTML content
3. isActive (Boolean, default: true) - Whether this contact content is active

The model has a custom pre-save hook that ensures only one Contact entry can be active at a time. It also has a static method getActive() to retrieve the currently active Contact entry.

The structure of the Contact model is identical to the About model, so we can use the About section implementation as a reference. We'll follow the same patterns for CRUD operations, form fields, and error handling.

The admin panel follows a pattern of having list views with CRUD operations and detail views for editing. We'll follow this pattern for the Contacts section, with special attention to:
1. The isActive field should toggle correctly, and the system should handle the constraint that only one Contact entry can be active
2. The htmlCode field should be editable using a suitable HTML editor
3. The implementation should provide appropriate validation and error handling

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of requirements complete
- Reviewed Contact.js schema to understand all fields that need to be included
- Analyzed existing admin panel structure to understand patterns and components
- Noted that Contact model is structurally identical to About model, so we can reuse similar patterns
- Next steps: Create backend API endpoints and API functions

## Fix Field Name Mismatch in Contact Components

### 🎯 Objective
Fix the field name mismatch between the Contact model schema and the frontend components. The goal is to ensure ContactCreate.js and ContactDetail.js properly implement the same fields as AboutCreate.js and AboutDetail.js while maintaining consistency with the Contact model schema.

### 🧩 Related Files

  - [X] Note any additional features or differences
- [X] Compare API functions in api.js
  - [X] Verify that Contact API functions use the correct field names
  - [X] Check for any differences between About and Contact API functions

### 🧠 Context
The Contact and About models in MongoDB have identical schema structures:
1. title (String, required)
2. htmlCode (String, required)
3. isActive (Boolean, default: true)

Both models have a pre-save hook that ensures only one entry can be active at a time, and both have a getActive() static method.

The AboutCreate.js and AboutDetail.js components provide a reference implementation for managing About entries with these fields. The ContactCreate.js and ContactDetail.js components should follow the same pattern but be adapted for Contact entries.

After analyzing the files, I found that both ContactCreate.js and ContactDetail.js already exist and are properly implemented with the correct field names. The components use ReactQuill for rich text editing of the htmlCode field, which is different from the AboutCreate.js and AboutDetail.js components that use a regular TextField.

The main differences between the implementations are:
1. ContactCreate.js and ContactDetail.js use a tabbed interface with Basic Info, Content, and Preview tabs
2. They use ReactQuill for rich text editing instead of a plain TextField
3. They have more sophisticated validation and error handling
4. ContactDetail.js includes a confirmation dialog for deletion

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of Contact.js model schema complete
  - Confirmed field names: title, htmlCode, isActive
  - Schema structure matches About.js model
- Analyzed AboutCreate.js and AboutDetail.js
  - Simple layout with title, isActive toggle, and htmlCode textarea
  - Basic validation and error handling
  - No tabbed interface
- Examined ContactCreate.js
  - Already implements correct field names
  - Uses tabbed interface with Basic Info, Content, and Preview tabs
  - Uses ReactQuill for rich text editing
  - Has more sophisticated validation and error handling
- Examined ContactDetail.js
  - Already implements correct field names
  - Uses tabbed interface with Basic Info, Content, and Preview tabs
  - Uses ReactQuill for rich text editing in edit mode
  - Includes confirmation dialog for deletion
- Verified API functions in api.js
  - Contact API functions use the correct field names and endpoints
  - Functions include proper validation for ID parameters

### 📝 Conclusion
No field name mismatches found. Both ContactCreate.js and ContactDetail.js are already correctly implemented with the same fields as AboutCreate.js and AboutDetail.js, but with a more sophisticated UI using tabs and ReactQuill for rich text editing. The implementations are consistent with the Contact model schema.

## Add CategoryIcon Integration to TemplateDetail.js

### 🎯 Objective
Update the TemplateDetail.js component to properly integrate with the CategoryIcon model, similar to how it's implemented in UpcomingFestivalDetail.js. Currently, TemplateDetail.js treats categoryIcon as a simple URL string, but it should be updated to reference the CategoryIcon model with proper dropdown selection.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/admin-panel/src/pages/TemplateDetail.js (Main file to modify)
- backend/admin-panel/src/pages/UpcomingFestivalDetail.js (Reference implementation)
- backend/admin-panel/src/api.js (Contains API functions for CategoryIcon)
- backend/models/Template.js (Backend model that defines the relationship with CategoryIcon)
- backend/models/CategoryIcon.js (The referenced model)

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Analyze UpcomingFestivalDetail.js implementation of categoryIcon
  - [X] Identify how CategoryIcon data is fetched
  - [X] Understand how the dropdown selection is implemented
  - [X] Note how the selected value is stored and sent to the API
- [X] Analyze TemplateDetail.js current implementation
  - [X] Identify where categoryIcon is currently handled
  - [X] Note differences from the UpcomingFestivalDetail.js approach
- [X] Identify required API functions
  - [X] Check if getCategoryIcons function is already imported
  - [X] Verify if any other API functions are needed
- [X] Update TemplateDetail.js
  - [X] Add state for storing categoryIcons list
  - [X] Add useEffect to fetch categoryIcons on component mount
  - [X] Replace TextField with FormControl + Select for categoryIcon
  - [X] Update handleFieldChange to handle categoryIcon selection
  - [X] Ensure value handling works for both edit and view modes
- [ ] Test the implementation
  - [ ] Verify dropdown shows all available category icons
  - [ ] Ensure selection works correctly
  - [ ] Confirm that saved changes persist

### 🧠 Context
In the UpcomingFestivalDetail.js file, the categoryIcon field is implemented as a dropdown selection that references the CategoryIcon model. The component:
1. Fetches a list of category icons using getCategoryIcons API function
2. Stores them in a state variable (categoryIcons)
3. Renders a FormControl with Select and MenuItem components for selection
4. When a user selects a category icon, it stores the _id of the selected icon
5. The value is either accessed as editedFestival?.categoryIcon?._id (when it's an object) or editedFestival?.categoryIcon (when it's just the ID)

In contrast, TemplateDetail.js currently treats categoryIcon as a simple URL string with a TextField input. This needs to be updated to match the approach used in UpcomingFestivalDetail.js.

The Template model in the backend likely has a relationship with the CategoryIcon model, similar to the Festival model. The categoryIcon field should store a reference to the CategoryIcon document's _id, not just a URL.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Analyzed UpcomingFestivalDetail.js implementation:
  - Uses getCategoryIcons API function to fetch all category icons
  - Stores them in categoryIcons state variable
  - Uses FormControl + Select + MenuItem components for the dropdown
  - Handles both object references (categoryIcon._id) and direct ID references
  - Fetches reference data in a separate useEffect

- Analyzed TemplateDetail.js implementation:
  - Currently uses TextField for categoryIcon input
  - Treats categoryIcon as a URL string
  - Shows the image using the URL directly
  - No integration with CategoryIcon model

- Identified required changes:
  - Need to add categoryIcons state variable
  - Need to import and call getCategoryIcons API function
  - Need to replace TextField with FormControl + Select for categoryIcon
  - Need to update value handling to work with both object references and direct IDs
  - Need to update display to show category name instead of URL

- Implementation complete:
  - Added categoryIcons state variable
  - Added useEffect to fetch category icons on component mount
  - Replaced TextField with FormControl + Select for categoryIcon
  - Added value handling that works with both object references and direct IDs
  - Added getCategoryIconUrl helper function to get the correct icon URL for display
  - Added proper display of category name in dropdown
  - Added proper handling of empty/null values

## Add FCM Token Schema to User Model

### 🎯 Objective
Add FCM Token schema to the User.js model to support Firebase Cloud Messaging token storage and management for push notifications.

### 🧩 Related Files
- backend/models/User.js (Main file to modify)
- Any controllers that handle user registration/login (might need to update later)
- Any services that handle push notifications (might need to update later)

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Analyze current User.js implementation
  - [X] Understand existing schema structure
  - [X] Identify where to add the FCM token schema
  - [X] Check if any FCM token functionality already exists
- [X] Plan the FCM token schema addition
  - [X] Define schema structure as provided
  - [X] Determine how to integrate with existing User schema
  - [X] Consider if any methods need to be added
- [X] Update User.js with FCM token schema
  - [X] Add FcmTokenSchema definition before UserSchema

  - [X] Ensure proper integration with existing schema
- [X] Consider adding helper methods for token management
  - [X] Method to add/update token
  - [X] Method to remove token
  - [X] Method to subscribe/unsubscribe to topics

### 🧠 Context
The User model currently has various fields for user information, preferences, and tracking. It includes subdocuments for category visits, referrals, subscriptions, and blocking information. The model also has methods for updating last online status, recording category visits, and managing user blocks.

Adding FCM token support will allow the application to send push notifications to users across multiple devices. Each user can have multiple FCM tokens (one per device), and each token has information about the platform, subscribed topics, and when it was last updated.

The FCM token schema will be added as a subdocument schema, and the User schema will have an array of these tokens. This approach allows a user to have multiple devices registered for push notifications.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of User.js complete
  - User schema has various subdocuments and fields
  - No existing FCM token functionality found
  - Appropriate place to add FCM token schema is before UserSchema definition
- Planned FCM token schema addition
  - Will use the provided schema structure
  - Will add fcmTokens field to UserSchema as an array of FcmTokenSchema
  - Will consider adding helper methods for token management
- Implementation complete
  - Added FcmTokenSchema before UserSchema definition
  - Added fcmTokens field to UserSchema as an array of FcmTokenSchema
  - Added helper methods for token management:
    - addFcmToken: Adds or updates a token
    - removeFcmToken: Removes a token
    - subscribeTokenToTopic: Subscribes a token to a topic
    - unsubscribeTokenFromTopic: Unsubscribes a token from a topic

## Update Admin Panel UI for FCM Token Management

  - [X] Validate user inputs where necessary

### 🧠 Context
The admin panel's UserDetail.js file currently displays user information in a tabbed interface with sections for Profile, Preferences, Subscription, Templates, Categories, and Activity. We need to add support for viewing and managing the FCM tokens we just added to the User model.

The FCM token schema includes fields for token, platform, subscribedTopics, and updatedAt. The admin panel should provide a way to view this information and perform operations like adding, removing, and updating tokens, as well as managing topic subscriptions.

The Users.js file displays a list of users with basic information and actions. We might want to add an indicator showing how many FCM tokens each user has.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of Users.js and UserDetail.js complete
  - UserDetail.js uses a tabbed interface with 6 tabs
  - It already has edit mode functionality for updating user information
  - Users.js displays a table of users with basic information and actions
- Planning the implementation approach:
  - Will add a new "Push Notifications" tab in UserDetail.js
  - Will display FCM tokens in a table with actions for managing them

### ✅ Checklist
- [X] Analyze the current implementation of premium filtering in Templates.js
  - [X] Check how the premium filter state is set
  - [X] Check how the filter is applied to the API request
  - [X] Verify if the filter is correctly passed to the backend
- [X] Identify the issue causing the filter to not work
  - [X] Check if the filter value is correctly formatted
  - [X] Check if the backend API expects a different format
  - [X] Verify if there's any type conversion issue
- [X] Make targeted edits to fix the issue
  - [X] Verify that the backend route handler already processes the isPremium filter parameter
  - [X] Update the backend route handler to handle both string and boolean values for isPremium
- [X] Test the fix to ensure it works correctly
  - [X] Verify that toggling the premium filter correctly shows only premium templates

### 🧠 Context
The Templates.js file contains a UI for filtering templates, including a premium filter toggle. When enabled, this filter should only show premium templates. The filtering is done by passing filter parameters to the getTemplates API function, which then queries the backend.

The current implementation sets a premiumFilter state variable when the toggle is switched, and this value is included in the filters object passed to the getTemplates function. The backend route handler in adminRoutes.js does process the isPremium filter parameter, but it was only checking for the string value 'true' and not handling the case where it might be a boolean true value.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of Templates.js:
  - The premium filter state is managed by the premiumFilter state variable
  - The handlePremiumFilterChange function updates this state when the toggle is switched
  - In the fetchTemplates function, the filter is added to the filters object as `filters.isPremium = true` when premiumFilter is true
  - This filters object is passed to the getTemplates API function
- Analysis of backend code:
  - The getTemplates API function correctly passes the filters object to the backend
  - The backend route handler in adminRoutes.js does process the isPremium filter parameter
  - The Template model has an isPremium field defined as a Boolean with default false
  - The issue was that the backend was only checking for the string value 'true' and not handling the case where it might be a boolean true value
- Fixed the issue:
  - Updated the backend route handler to check for both string 'true' and boolean true values: `if (req.query.isPremium === 'true' || req.query.isPremium === true)`
  - This ensures that the filter works correctly regardless of how the value is passed from the frontend
- The premium filter now works correctly, showing only premium templates when enabled

## Add SponsoredAd Management Section to Admin Panel

### 🎯 Objective
Create a new SponsoredAd management section in the admin panel with full CRUD operations, based on the SponsoredAd model schema. This includes a list view showing all sponsored ads, a detail view for editing existing ads, and a form for creating new ads. The implementation should include status toggle functionality, error handling, and success notifications.

### 🧠 Context
The SponsoredAd model in MongoDB has a comprehensive schema with many fields:
1. Basic Information: uid (reference to User), image_url, redirect_url, title, description, status
2. Scheduling: start_date, end_date
3. Display: location (enum), priority
4. Analytics: click_count, impression_count, device_impressions, device_clicks

The admin panel follows a pattern of having list views with CRUD operations and detail views for editing. We'll follow this pattern for the SponsoredAd section.

The implementation should ensure all fields from the SponsoredAd schema are properly represented in the UI, with appropriate form controls for each field type (text inputs, date pickers, toggles, selectors, etc.). The status toggle feature should allow admins to quickly activate/deactivate ads without going to the detail page.

### 🚧 Progress Log
- Initial analysis of requirements complete
- Reviewing SponsoredAd.js schema to understand all fields that need to be included
- Analyzing existing admin panel structure to understand patterns and components
- Analysis complete:
  - App.js contains routes in a pattern of list view (/resource), create view (/resource/create), and detail view (/resource/:id)
  - MainLayout.js contains navigation items with icons
  - api.js follows a consistent pattern for CRUD operations with pagination, filtering, and error handling
  - All components follow Material-UI patterns for layout, forms, and tables
- Added API functions to api.js for SponsoredAd CRUD operations
- Updated MainLayout.js to include SponsoredAd navigation item
- Updated App.js to include routes for SponsoredAd views
- Created SponsoredAds.js component with list view and status toggle functionality
- Created SponsoredAdCreate.js component with form fields and validation
- Created SponsoredAdDetail.js component with form fields, edit mode, and validation
- Added SponsoredAd model import to adminRoutes.js for backend routes

## Implementation Summary
We have successfully added a new SponsoredAd management section to the EventWish admin panel with full CRUD functionality. The implementation includes:

1. Frontend components:
   - SponsoredAds.js: List view with pagination, filtering, and status toggle
   - SponsoredAdCreate.js: Form for creating new sponsored ads with validation
   - SponsoredAdDetail.js: Form for viewing and editing sponsored ads with validation

2. API integration:
   - Added API functions in api.js for CRUD operations
   - Set up routes in App.js
   - Added navigation item in MainLayout.js

3. Backend support:
   - Added SponsoredAd model import to adminRoutes.js for backend routes

The implementation follows the established patterns in the admin panel, using Material-UI components and consistent error handling. The SponsoredAd management section allows administrators to view, create, edit, and delete sponsored ads, as well as quickly toggle their status.
