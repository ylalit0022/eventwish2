# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When searching for recent news, use the current year (2025) instead of previous years, or simply use the "recent" keyword to get the latest information
- When implementing singleton classes in Android, ensure proper initialization before use:
  - Add an explicit init() method that takes a Context parameter
  - Check for null context and use applicationContext to prevent memory leaks
  - Add proper error handling with clear error messages

  - Check for null and empty string separately when working with String IDs
  - Add explicit type conversions if comparison between different types is needed (Integer.parseInt())
- When working with lambda expressions in Java:
  - Variables captured in lambda expressions must be final or effectively final

## Application Overview

EventWish is an Android application that allows users to create and share event wishes, manage templates, track festivals, and set reminders. The app follows a modern Android architecture with MVVM pattern, Repository pattern, and leverages Room for local database storage.

### Main Features
- Template-based wish creation
- Social media sharing
- Festival tracking and notifications
- Reminder system
- AdMob integration
- Analytics tracking
- Deep linking support

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern:

- **Model**: Data layer with repositories, data sources, and Room database
- **View**: Activities and Fragments
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and handles business logic

### Core Components
- `EventWishApplication`: Application class that initializes all core services
- `MainActivity`: Main activity that hosts the navigation component
- Various repositories for data management
- Room database for local storage
- Retrofit for API communication
- WorkManager for background tasks

## Key Components

### Main Modules

1. **UI Module (`com.ds.eventwish.ui`)**
   - Activities and Fragments for different app screens
   - ViewModels that manage UI state
   - Custom views and adapters

2. **Data Module (`com.ds.eventwish.data`)**
   - Repositories that coordinate data access
   - Database entities and DAOs
   - Remote API client and services
   - Local storage utilities

3. **Utility Module (`com.ds.eventwish.utils` and `com.ds.eventwish.util`)**
   - Helper classes for various functionalities
   - Time and date utilities
   - Security and encryption
   - Analytics tracking

4. **Ad Module (`com.ds.eventwish.ads`)**
   - AdMob integration
   - Different ad formats (Interstitial, Native, Rewarded, App Open)
   - Ad unit management

5. **Workers (`com.ds.eventwish.workers`)**
   - Background tasks managed by WorkManager
   - Reminder checks
   - Template updates

6. **Receivers (`com.ds.eventwish.receivers`)**
   - Broadcast receivers for system events
   - Alarm receivers
   - Boot completed receiver

### Navigation

The app uses the Android Navigation Component with a single activity (`MainActivity`) hosting multiple fragments. Navigation is defined in:
- `app/src/main/res/navigation/nav_graph.xml`: Main navigation graph
- `app/src/main/res/navigation/mobile_navigation.xml`: Bottom navigation
- `app/src/main/res/navigation/auth_navigation.xml`: Authentication flow

## Authentication & Security

Authentication is managed through:
- `SecureTokenManager`: Handles secure storage of tokens and sensitive data
- `TokenRepository`: Manages token retrieval and renewal
- `UserRepository`: Handles user registration and authentication

Security considerations:
- API keys are stored securely
- Device IDs are hashed for privacy
- Network calls are secured with HTTPS

## Database Structure

The app uses Room database for local storage. Main entities include:

1. **Template**: Design templates for wishes
2. **Category**: Template categories
3. **Festival**: Holiday and event information
4. **Reminder**: User-set reminders
5. **AdUnit**: Ad configuration data

Database migrations are handled in the `AppDatabase` class. The database version should be incremented when schema changes occur.

## API Services

API communication is handled by Retrofit through:
- `ApiClient`: Configures Retrofit and OkHttp
- `ApiService`: Defines API endpoints

Main API endpoints:
- Template APIs: Fetch and manage templates
- Festival APIs: Retrieve festival information
- Ad unit APIs: Get ad configuration
- User APIs: Registration and authentication

## Ad Integration

The app uses Google AdMob for advertising with multiple ad formats:

1. **App Open Ads**: Shown when the app is opened (`AppOpenManager`)
2. **Interstitial Ads**: Full-screen ads between screens (`InterstitialAdManager`)
3. **Native Ads**: Custom format ads integrated into the UI (`NativeAdHelper`)
4. **Rewarded Ads**: Ads that reward users (`RewardedAdManager`)

Ad configuration is fetched from the server via the `AdMobRepository` and cached locally.

## Analytics Implementation

Analytics tracking is centralized in the `AnalyticsUtils` class, which provides methods for tracking:
- Screen views
- User interactions (clicks, searches)
- Content engagement
- Ad performance
- Error events

Privacy features include:
- User opt-out mechanism
- No collection of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Device information tracking in compliance with Play Store policies

## Notifications & Reminders

The app has a comprehensive notification system:
- `EventWishNotificationManager`: Creates and manages notifications
- `NotificationScheduler`: Schedules notifications at specific times
- `ReminderScheduler`: Handles reminder-specific scheduling

Reminder features:
- User-configurable reminders for events
- Persistent notification for active reminders
- Background checking using WorkManager

## Deep Links

The app supports deep linking to specific content:
- Wishes: `eventwish://wish/{id}`
- Festivals: `eventwish://festival/{id}` 
- Templates: `eventwish://template/{id}`

HTTP(S) deep links:
- `https://eventwishes.onrender.com/wish/{id}`
- `https://eventwishes.onrender.com/festival/{id}`
- `https://eventwishes.onrender.com/template/{id}`

Deep link handling is managed in the `DeepLinkHandler` class.

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance

1. **Update dependencies**:
   - Regularly update dependencies in `build.gradle` files
   - Test thoroughly after updates
   - Pay special attention to Firebase, AdMob, and AndroidX updates

2. **Database migrations**:
   - When changing the database schema, create migration classes
   - Test migrations on devices with existing data
   - Increment the database version number

3. **API changes**:
   - Update ApiService interface with new endpoints
   - Update corresponding repository methods
   - Add appropriate error handling

4. **Ad unit management**:
   - Periodically check ad unit performance
   - Update ad unit IDs in the backend when needed
   - Ensure test ads are used in debug builds

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Network connectivity issues**:
   - Check `ApiClient` configuration
   - Verify `InternetConnectivityChecker` functionality
   - Check certificate pinning configuration

2. **Notification problems**:
   - Verify channel creation in `EventWishApplication`
   - Check Android version-specific notification code
   - Verify alarm permissions on Android 12+

3. **Database errors**:
   - Check migration path for schema changes
   - Verify entity annotations and DAOs
   - Check for thread-safety issues with LiveData

4. **Ad loading issues**:
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check ad unit IDs in the database
   - Verify test mode is enabled in debug builds

## Known Issues

1. LiveData updates from background threads should use postValue() instead of setValue()
2. AdMob initialization must complete before using other ad components
3. SecureTokenManager.init() must be called before getInstance()
4. Proper initialization order of singletons is critical for dependency management

## Build & Deployment

### Build Types
- **Debug**: Development version with test ads and verbose logging
- **Release**: Production version with optimizations and release ad units

3. The ability to force check for updates by clicking the button
4. Silent update checking to update the indicator status

### Testing Plan
1. Test with no update available:
   - Red indicator should not be visible
   - Clicking "Check for Updates" should show "No update available" message

2. Test with update available:
   - Red indicator should be visible
   - Clicking "Check for Updates" should trigger the update flow

3. Test after app restart:
   - Indicator state should persist based on update availability

### Implementation Timeline
1. [ ] Day 1: Add dependencies and create RemoteConfigManager

## Firebase Remote Config for Dynamic Share Messages

### Current Implementation
- Currently, the `handleShareVia` method uses hardcoded share text from string resources
- No caching mechanism for remote messages
- No dynamic placeholder replacement for sender/recipient names

### Requirements
1. Fetch share message from Firebase Remote Config parameter "share_message"
2. Support dynamic placeholders for sender and recipient names
3. Implement 24-hour cache expiration for fetched messages
4. Graceful fallback to local strings if remote fetch fails

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Firebase Remote Config Setup
- [X] Ensure Firebase Remote Config is properly initialized in the app
- [X] Add default values for "share_message" parameter
- [X] Configure Remote Config in Firebase Console with appropriate message templates

#### 2. Create ShareMessageManager Class
- [X] Create a new class `ShareMessageManager` to handle fetching and caching of share messages
- [X] Implement singleton pattern for easy access
- [X] Add methods for fetching, caching, and retrieving share messages

#### 3. Implement Caching Mechanism
- [X] Use SharedPreferences to store cached messages
- [X] Store timestamp alongside cached messages
- [X] Implement cache validity check (24-hour expiration)
- [X] Add methods to clear expired cache

#### 4. Add Placeholder Processing
- [X] Implement placeholder replacement logic for:
  - `{{sender_name}}` - Replace with sender's name
  - `{{recipient_name}}` - Replace with recipient's name
  - `{{share_url}}` - Replace with the share URL
- [X] Add fallback for missing placeholder values

#### 5. Update handleShareVia Method
- [X] Modify to use ShareMessageManager to get share text
- [X] Pass sender and recipient names for placeholder replacement
- [X] Handle cases where remote config fetch fails
- [X] Maintain platform-specific customization if needed

#### 6. Testing and Validation
- [X] Test with various placeholder combinations
- [X] Test cache expiration logic
- [X] Test fallback to default messages
- [X] Verify proper message formatting across platforms

### Implementation Summary

1. Created `ShareMessageManager` class with:
   - Singleton pattern for easy access
   - Caching with 24-hour expiration using SharedPreferences
   - Platform-specific message support
   - Placeholder replacement for sender name, recipient name, and share URL

2. Updated string resources to use placeholders:
   - Changed format strings to use `{{placeholder}}` syntax
   - Added platform-specific message templates

3. Updated `handleShareVia` method to:
   - Get dynamic share message from ShareMessageManager
   - Pass sender name, recipient name, and share URL for placeholder replacement
   - Support platform-specific messages

4. Added initialization in `EventWishApplication`:
   - Initialize ShareMessageManager during app startup
   - Preload share messages when viewing shared wishes

5. Added preloading in `SharedWishFragment`:
   - Fetch messages in advance when viewing shared wishes
   - Use cached messages when sharing

### Benefits Achieved
- Dynamically updatable share messages without app updates
- Personalized messages with sender/recipient names
- Reduced network requests with caching
- Graceful fallback to local resources
- A/B testing capability for share messages
