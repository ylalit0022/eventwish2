# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## Screenshot Verification

The screenshot verification workflow allows you to capture screenshots of web pages and verify their appearance using LLMs. The following tools are available:

1. Screenshot Capture:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/screenshot_utils.py URL [--output OUTPUT] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
```

2. LLM Verification with Images:
```bash
venv/bin/python tools/llm_api.py --prompt "Your verification question" --provider {openai|anthropic} --image path/to/screenshot.png
```

Example workflow:
```python
from screenshot_utils import take_screenshot_sync
from llm_api import query_llm

# Take a screenshot

screenshot_path = take_screenshot_sync('https://example.com', 'screenshot.png')

# Verify with LLM

response = query_llm(
    "What is the background color and title of this webpage?",
    provider="openai",  # or "anthropic"
    image_path=screenshot_path
)
print(response)
```

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?" --provider "anthropic"
```

The LLM API supports multiple providers:
- OpenAI (default, model: gpt-4o)
- Azure OpenAI (model: configured via AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT in .env file, defaults to gpt-4o-ms)
- DeepSeek (model: deepseek-chat)
- Anthropic (model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- Gemini (model: gemini-pro)
- Local LLM (model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ)

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
venv/bin/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```
If needed, you can further use the `web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web page content.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

# Scratchpad

## Current Task: Background User Registration Feature

### Problem Statement
The app needs to implement automatic background user registration with the server when a user first opens the app. The key requirements are:
1. Register new users with their device ID as a unique identifier
2. Track when users were last online
3. Record user activity history, specifically which categories they visit
4. Implementation should be done server-side in the existing backend

### Data Model
For the `users` collection/table:
```
{
  deviceId: String,          // Unique identifier from the device
  lastOnline: Date,          // Timestamp of last activity
  created: Date,             // When user was first registered
  categories: [              // Array of category visit history
    {
      category: String,      // Category name/ID
      visitDate: Date        // When the category was visited
    }
  ]
}
```

### Action Plan
[X] 1. Server-side implementation:
   - Create a User model schema in the backend
   - Implement API endpoints for user registration and activity tracking
   - Set up proper validation and error handling
   - Implement device ID verification

[X] 2. Client-side implementation:
   - Add background registration when app is first opened
   - Implement background category visit tracking
   - Set up periodic last online updates
   - Handle network errors gracefully

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Server-side (Backend):
[X] Create User model schema (models/User.js):
   - Defined schema with deviceId, lastOnline, created, and categories fields
   - Added indexes for efficient querying
   - Implemented validation for incoming data
   - Added helper methods for updating lastOnline and category visits

[X] Create API routes (routes/users.js):
   - POST /api/users/register - Register new user with device ID
   - PUT /api/users/activity - Update user's last online and category visits
   - GET /api/users/:deviceId - Get user data (for testing)
   - Added proper error handling and validation

[X] Implement middleware:
   - Created validators.js middleware for input validation
   - Added validation for device IDs and category names
   - Implementation includes input sanitization and format checking

[X] Update server.js:
   - Added the new user routes to app.js
   - Set up logger utility for proper logging

#### 2. Client-side (Android App):
[X] Generate and store unique device ID:
   - Created UserRepository with device ID generation and storage
   - Used Android ID with fallback to UUID generation
   - Added SHA-256 hashing for privacy protection
   - Store securely in SharedPreferences

[X] Implement background registration:
   - Added user registration in EventWishApplication.onCreate
   - Implemented API endpoints in ApiService
   - Added error handling and retry logic
   - Created asynchronous registration using Executor

[X] Track category visits:
   - Updated HomeFragment to send category visit data
   - Implemented tracking in category selection click handler
   - Added special handling for "All" category
   - Rate limiting to prevent too frequent updates (5 minute interval)

[X] Update last online status:
   - Implemented period updates in onActivityResumed
   - Added throttling to prevent excessive API calls
   - Proper error handling for network failures

### Completion Notes
The background user registration feature has been successfully implemented:

1. **Server-side components** provide a robust system for tracking user activity:
   - The `User` model with proper schema and validation
   - Complete API endpoints with proper error handling
   - Input validation middleware to ensure data integrity
   - Logging for debugging and monitoring

2. **Client-side implementation** handles automatic registration and tracking:
   - Secure device ID generation with privacy protections
   - Background registration when the app first starts
   - Tracking of category visits when users browse different categories
   - Automatic updates of online status as users use the app
   - Rate limiting to prevent server overload

These changes enable valuable analytics capabilities while maintaining user privacy. The system is designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive, with minimal impact on app performance. The collected data can be used for future personalization features, allowing the app to recommend templates based on users' browsing patterns.

## Previous Task: Improve UI/UX Elements

### Problem Statement
Three UI/UX issues need to be addressed to improve the user experience:
1. Swipe refresh loader is not showing when app is first opened, giving no indication that data is being fetched
2. When a category is selected, there's no visual indication (highlighting) to show which category is active
3. When users press the back button to exit the app from the HomeFragment, there's no confirmation, which can lead to accidental exits

### Action Plan
[X] 1. Fix swipe refresh loader visibility:
   - Modify HomeFragment to show the swipe refresh indicator when the app first loads data
   - Ensure the indicator is properly shown during initial data fetch and disappears when complete
   - Add proper coordination between loading states and the SwipeRefreshLayout

[X] 2. Implement category selection highlighting:
   - Enhance the CategoriesAdapter to properly highlight the selected category
   - Add visual styling for the active category (background color, text color change, etc.)
   - Ensure the highlighting persists when navigating back to HomeFragment
   - Update the category item layout to support highlighting states
   - Fixed "All" category not highlighting properly with improved null handling logic

[X] 3. Add back button exit confirmation:
   - Implement double-back-press detection in HomeFragment
   - Add a toast message notifying users to "Press back again to exit"
   - Set up a timer to reset the back press state after a short delay
   - Handle the back button press through the OnBackPressedCallback interface

### Implementation Details
1. **Swipe Refresh Loader**:
   - Update HomeFragment.onViewCreated to trigger SwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true) during initial load
   - Improved loading state observer to coordinate with the SwipeRefreshLayout indicator
   - Added a small delay before hiding the refresh indicator for better visibility

2. **Category Selection Highlighting**:
   - Added a selectedCategoryId field to CategoriesAdapter to track the selected category
   - Updated onBindViewHolder to apply different styling for selected items (colors for text and icon)
   - Using the existing bg_category_selector drawable that already had selected state styling
   - Improved updateSelectedCategory method to check for unchanged selections for better performance
   - Fixed "All" category highlighting by improving the null-handling logic in isSelected calculation
   - Made the selection logic more explicit with separate conditions for null (All category) and non-null cases

3. **Back Button Exit Confirmation**:
   - Added backPressedTime variable and BACK_PRESS_DELAY constant for tracking double-press timing
   - Implemented setupBackPressHandling() with OnBackPressedCallback to handle back button presses
   - Added toast message with "Press back again to exit" on first press
   - Added a string resource for the exit message
   - Implemented app exit on second press if within the time window (2 seconds)

### Completion Notes
All three UI/UX issues have been successfully addressed:
1. The swipe refresh loader now provides proper visual feedback during initial data loading
2. Categories are now visually highlighted when selected, with color changes to both text and icons, including special handling for the "All" category 
3. Users now get a clear confirmation message when attempting to exit the app, preventing accidental exits

These improvements collectively enhance the user experience by providing better visual feedback and navigation controls.

## Previous Task: Fix UI Flow and Navigation Issues

### Problem Statement
Three specific issues in the app's UI flow and navigation needed to be addressed:
1. When navigating from TemplateCustomizeFragment back to HomeFragment, data is unnecessarily reloaded
2. When the app is first opened, only default category icons are shown until a manual refresh
3. Clicking on the profile bottom navigation item doesn't navigate correctly

### Action Plan
[X] 1. Fix HomeFragment data state persistence:
   - Modify onResume to avoid full data reloading when coming from another fragment
   - Add isNavigatingToAnotherFragment helper to distinguish between background transitions and in-app navigation
   - Save and restore scroll position when returning from other fragments

[X] 2. Fix category icons loading:
   - Force refresh category icons when HomeFragment is first created
   - Explicitly load categories immediately when setting up the categories RecyclerView
   - Ensure both default and dynamic category icons are available on first load

[X] 3. Fix profile navigation:
   - Add special handling for profile navigation in MainActivity's setupNavigation method
   - Directly navigate to the profile fragment when the profile menu item is clicked
   - Log navigation events for easier debugging

### Implementation Notes
The key issues were:

1. **Fragment Navigation State**:
   - The app was treating navigation between fragments the same as coming back from background
   - This caused unnecessary API calls and data reloading
   - Fixed by adding better state tracking to distinguish between different navigation types

2. **Category Icons Loading**:
   - CategoryIconRepository was only loading default icons initially
   - Dynamic icons were only fetched when manually refreshed
   - Fixed by forcing an immediate refresh when the fragment is first created

3. **Bottom Navigation**:
   - Profile tab navigation was relying on standard NavigationUI behavior which had issues
   - Fixed by adding special handling similar to how home navigation was handled
   - Now explicitly navigates to profile destination when the tab is selected

### Completion Notes
All three issues have been successfully fixed:
1. HomeFragment now maintains its data state when navigating between fragments
2. Category icons are properly loaded on first app launch without requiring manual refresh
3. Profile navigation works correctly when clicking the profile tab in the bottom navigation

The build completed successfully with no errors, indicating that all changes integrate well with the existing codebase.
